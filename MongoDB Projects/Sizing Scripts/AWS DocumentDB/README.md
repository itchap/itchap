# AWS DocumentDB Sizing Script

## Overview

This repository contains a MongoDB sizing script designed for AWS DocumentDB. The script, `getDocDBSizing.js`, retrieves sizing information for each database in a DocumentDB cluster. This README provides instructions on how to download and use the script.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Script

Download the [getDocDBSizing.js](https://github.com/itchap/mongodb-guides/blob/main/Sizing%20Scripts/AWS%20DocumentDB/getDocDBSizing.js) script to a server that has network access to the DocumentDB cluster.

### Step 2: Connect to the DocumentDB Cluster

Run the following command to connect to the cluster on the admin database and output the sizing information:

#### Using `mongo` (Mongo Shell):
```bash
mongo --host <hostname>:27017 --ssl --sslCAFile global-bundle.pem --username <username> --password <password> getDocDBSizing.js > DocDBSizing.txt
```
#### Using mongosh (MongoDB Shell):
```bash
mongosh mongodb://<hostname>:27017/admin --tls --tlsCAFile global-bundle.pem -u <username> -p <password> getDocDBSizing.js > DocDBSizing.txt
```
Replace `<hostname>`, `<username>`, and `<password>` with your DocumentDB cluster details.

### Step 3: Review Sizing Information

The script will output sizing information for the cluster and each database to the `DocDBSizing.txt` file. Review the contents of this file for a summary of the total data, storage, and index sizes across all databases.

Finally send the `getMongoData.txt` file via email to your MongoDB Sales team for review and pricing.

This script is provided as-is and is not officially supported by AWS or MongoDB. Use it at your own discretion and ensure compatibility with your DocumentDB cluster version and configuration.
